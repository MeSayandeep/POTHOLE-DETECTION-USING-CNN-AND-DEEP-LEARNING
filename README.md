# POTHOLE-DETECTION-USING-CNN-AND-DEEP-LEARNING

Real time pothole detection by using ML and neural network.

1st of all a pre-downloaded dataset from Kaggle is trained and labeled, then it is passed through a CNN model and calculate the accuracy and loss of our model. 3 dense layer of neurons are used and in those layers activation function "relu" is applied, we can also use sigmoid or softmax activation function. And for calculating the loss, binary-crossentropy function  and "adam" optimizer is use to optimize the loss. We can also use the catagorical-crossentropy loss function. And then a prediction  function is built to see how our model is predicting whether it is a pothole or not.
