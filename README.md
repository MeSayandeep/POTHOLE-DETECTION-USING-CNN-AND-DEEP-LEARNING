# POTHOLE-DETECTION-USING-CNN-AND-DEEP-LEARNING

<h2 align="center">Real time pothole detection by using ML and neural network in GOOGLE COLAB</h2>

In this work, a dataset has been adapted for experimental work. This dataset consists of two different image sets i.e., normal roads and potholes. All the images of the dataset have been labeled. We have taken a dataset from Kaggle and trained the dataset using Python Machine learning. The dataset contains 352 normal road images and
329 pothole images. Then it is passed through a CNN model and calculate the accuracy and loss of our model. 3 dense layer of neurons are used and in those layers activation function "relu" is applied, we can also use sigmoid or softmax activation function. And for calculating the loss, binary-crossentropy function  and "adam" optimizer is use to optimize the loss. We can also use the catagorical-crossentropy loss function. And then a prediction  function is built to see how our model is predicting whether it is a pothole or not.
